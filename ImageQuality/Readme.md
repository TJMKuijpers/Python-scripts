<h3> Image quality control scripts </h3>

This repository contains various small quality control scripts. <br>

<h5> Outlier identifier </h5>
This basic script can be used to compare a + or - cell type count against the total population count in one image. <br>
When there are more +/- cells identified (higher count) compared to the total count, a false segmentation occured in CellProfiler. <br>
