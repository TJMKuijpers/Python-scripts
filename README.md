<h3> Python scripts </h3>

This repository is a collection of python scripts that can be used to visualize data (Data exploration), check the image quality (ImageQuality), and to find the contours in a binary image (findContoursBinaryImage). The subprojects ImageQuality and findContourBinaryImage are in an alpha version and might not work properly. The Data exploration functions are ready to be used for data visualization. <br>

<h4> Data exploration </h4>
This project contains the a python class DataExploration that can be used to create a histogram, violin plot, lmplot, and data descriptives. The CreatePCA, CreateTSNE, and CalculateSVD classes can be used to get an understanding of the variance in your data, as well as to identify potential outliers or batch effects. 
For a more detailed instruction on how to use these classes, please check the readme file in the folder Data exploration.
